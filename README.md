## Introduction
We have been tasked with predicting when and where different species of mosquitoes will test positive for West Nile Virus in Chicago based on the given datasets.  This is part of the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus) competition of the same name.

## Dataset

The datasets were available on Kaggle and were provided by the [Chicago Department of Health](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph.html).  The data was comprised of weather data, spray data, train, and test data:
- Weather:  Various types of weather data from 2007-2014 collected at O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport
- Spray:   GIS data of spraying efforts in 2011 and 2013
- Train/Test:   The main datasets consisting of Date, Mosquito Trap ID's, Number of Mosquitoes caught in each trap, and whether West Nile Virus was present in any of these mosquitoes
